<h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3>

I began my journey in Computer Science just over a year ago, starting with a basic Python course that ignited my passion for coding. This experience led me to pursue a Master's in Computer Science, where I explored various languages and applied them in university projects and team settings.

I also completed the JavaScript Kickstarter Course through Code First Girls, sponsored by Admiral. This 8-week program focused on web development using JavaScript, and I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was proud to emerge as the winner in my cohort for the final project.

Currently, I am working on my dissertation, which involves the creation and evaluation of a financial management tracking website.

I am excited to secure my first role in tech!
