 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Hanna's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

I started my journey in Computer Science just over a year ago. I had a dream to learn how to code and enrolled myself onto a basics Python course. Here I learnt the basics of Python, and got a feel for coding in general. After this, I decided to do a Masters course in Computer Science. Here I discovered more langauges, had opportunity to practically create projects through University assignments and work as a team.

I had the opportunity to complete the Javascript Kickstarter Course through Code First Girls (sponsored by Admiral.
This was an 8 week program on web development using JavaScript. I had the oppportunity to developed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also emerged as the winner in my cohort for the final projec

I am currently completing my dissertation which is the creation and evaluation of a financial management tracking website.

I can't wait to secure my first role in tech!
